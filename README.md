# Simple Chat API

A straightforward chat API in Golang using WebSocket for real-time messaging. This project is designed for foundational learning and understanding the basics of building a real-time communication system.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to create a simple chat API with real-time messaging capabilities. We'll be using Go-chi for building the API and nhooyr/websocket for WebSocket functionality.

## Project Structure

- [ ] Structure all the code for easy navigation and maintainability.
- [ ] Build the basic API using [Go-chi](https://github.com/go-chi/chi).
- [ ] Implement a basic WebSocket server using [nhooyr/websocket](https://github.com/nhooyr/websocket).
- [ ] Create functionality for connecting to chat rooms, waiting for partners, and handling disconnections.

## Frontend Usage

- [ ] Develop a simple and easy-to-use frontend using Golang's built-in HTML templating language with [templ](https://github.com/a-h/templ).
- [ ] Create a basic user interface to facilitate testing and interaction with the chat API.
- [ ] Provide a straightforward link for users to access and test the chat API.
